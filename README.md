# bevy_xr_app

> Starter Bevy OpenXR app

`bevy_xr_app` is a ready-to-go starter template for using OpenXR with Bevy. It includes basic _scene editor_ support (thanks to `bevy_editor_pls`). It also includes an OpenXR simulator with WASD + Mouse input so you can develop XR applications without putting on a headset.

`bevy_xr_app` is tested on both MacOS and Windows, including the built-in OpenXR simulator.
